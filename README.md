# UNoVSync
Ubisoft apparently didn't include an option to toggle vsync in their [game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470220/UNO/). So I forced it off myself.

### - Why did you make this?

I know having vsync off for a card game sounds a bit silly, but I really didn't like how I was locked to 60 fps with no way to turn it off. It doesn't affect anything with the gameplay either. So it exists for those that want it.

### - What all has been changed with your mod?

Nothing that would alter your gameplay or online interactions. I did some small personal changes before the game actually reaches the menu (listed below). And made a toggable GUI in the Settings to turn vsync on or off.

Here are the changes I've made with the game:

- Text that displays before the game reaches the menu ("Attaching Uplay service.", "Loading title screen.") 
- Intro video has been removed.
- Title screen music has been removed
- ExiMichi's [UNO skins](https://github.com/linkthehylian/UNoVSync/wiki/ExiMichi's-UNO-Skins)
- V-Sync toggle in Settings (takes immediate effect)

### - Are you able to fix the disconnection issues?

Probably not. That's something on Ubisoft's end.
