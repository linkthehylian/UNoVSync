# UNoVSync
For Ubisoft's [UNO 2016](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470220/UNO/) game.

### - Why did you make this?

I know having vsync off for a card game sounds a bit silly, but I really didn't like how I was locked to 60 fps with no way to turn it off. It doesn't affect anything with the gameplay either. So it exists for those that want it.

### - What all has been changed with your mod?

Nothing that would alter your gameplay or online interactions. I did some small personal changes before the game actually reaches the menu (listed below). And made a toggable GUI in the Settings to turn vsync on or off.

Here are the changes I've made with the game:

- Text that displays before the game reaches the menu ("Attaching Uplay service.", "Loading title screen.") 
- Intro video has been removed.
- Title screen music has been removed
- ExiMichi's [UNO skins](https://github.com/linkthehylian/UNoVSync/wiki/ExiMichi's-UNO-Skins)
- V-Sync toggle in Settings (takes immediate effect)

### - Can I get banned for using this?

No, all modifications I (myself) and ExiMichi have made are local changes and only affect you.

### - When do you roll out updates for the mod?

When Ubisoft rolls out new updates for their game.

### - Am I allowed to make modifications to this and redistribute it?

Rather you wouldn't, if you want something added/modified you can contact me (found below).

### - Are you able to fix the disconnection issues?

Probably not. That's something on Ubisoft's end.

### - Can I contact you if I have any questions?

Sure.
